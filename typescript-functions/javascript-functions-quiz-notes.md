## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a function is a block of code that can be repeatedly called in order to do some
  kind of operation

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function functionName(a1: type, a2: type): returnType{
  code
  .
  .
  }

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  let someResult = functionName(value1, value2);

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  a function definition lays out the blueprint for what the function should do, and the function call
  is telling said function to complete some type of operation

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  an argument is tied to the function definition, where as the parameter is tied to the
  function call

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  parameters allow us to pass in data to a function when such a thing is necessary

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  the return statement can return a value that is evaluated during the block of code above it, or
  simply return undefined if no such value is necessary

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  let arrowFunction = (a1, a2) => {
  code
  .
  .
  };

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  the function now has an implicit return
