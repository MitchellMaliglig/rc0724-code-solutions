## Quiz Questions

  determines whether or not the loop will continue to run

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  iteration refers to the process of going through a block of code in a loop

  before the while loop and after an iteration

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  once before the for loop begins to iterate

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  before each iteration of a for loop

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  after each iteration

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  break

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  shorthand for a = a + 1;

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
